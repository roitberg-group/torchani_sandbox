**TorchANI** is an open-source library that supports training, development, and research
of ANI-style neural network interatomic potentials. It was originally developed and is
currently maintained by the Roitberg group.

If you were using **TorchANI** before version 3, your code may need updating to be
compatible with its new features. Please consult (ADD LINK) for information on this. If
you still have problems, please open an issue in github (TODO ADD LINK).

If you use the features in **TorchANI**, please cite the corresponding articles
(TODO add link to page).
